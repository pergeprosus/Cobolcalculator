# Cobolcalculator
The purpose of this project is to simultaneously display and reaffirm my personal understanding of COBOL. 
This program requests two numbers, which are to be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided. It will then
display the answer, and if the user's inputs are invalid, it will output an error.
